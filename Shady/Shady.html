House Shade Simulation</h1>
This is a simulation of the shade on a house.&nbsp; It computes the length
of the shadows cast by an overhang and a wingwall as a function of time,
date, and latitude.
<ul>
<li>
To the left is a view of the front of the house (viewing the wingwall edge-on)
and to the right is a side view.</li>

<li>
Click on the front view to reposition the windows.</li>

<li>
Click on the right of the side view to redefine the width of the overhang,
and on the left of the side view to redefine the width of the wingwall.</li>

<li>
Click on the compass to define geographic north.&nbsp; The front view is
facing the direction on the bottom of the compass.&nbsp; For example, it
starts out facing south.</li>

<li>
You can type in the latitude of the house below the compass.&nbsp; (Longitude
is unnecessary, since we use local solar time instead of GMT.)</li>

<li>
Click on the "calendar" or the clock to define a month and time.</li>
</ul>
You can run the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button.&nbsp; By checking
"Run year" you can cycle through a day at a second per hour; by checking"Run
day" you can run through the year at a second per month.
