Java Applet HVAC Simulations</h2>
For you HVAC affectionados, we have some great simulations available for
you to check out. You must have a Java-enabled Browser - like Netscape
- on a fast machine. Otherwise the simulations are like waiting for global
warming.
<ul>
<li>
Examine how the <a href="Refrig/index.htm">HVAC system loops and components</a>
fit together.</li>

<li>
See how an <a href="Psych/AHU.html">AHU interacts with the psychrometric
chart</a>.</li>

<li>
Learn to tune a <a href="PID/PID.html">PID controller</a> through a simulated
application.</li>

<li>
Watch the <a href="HVACSim/HVACSim.html">interaction of flow control valves</a>
in a distribution system.</li>

<li>
Click <a href="http://www.ecsel.psu.edu/setce/frames/framenav.html">here</a>
to learn more about the BEST program where these pages originated.</li>

<li>
We are currently developing a fairly detailed simulation of the <a href="EnergySim/EnergySim.html">cooling
system </a>of a building; it is currently unfinished.</li>
</ul>
We have also put some HVAC processes to <a href="http://www2.fe.psu.edu/~dxm15/Classes/Classes.htm">music</a>
if you are looking for some goofy fun.
<p>Please forward any comments, questions, or suggestions concerning HVAC
to <a href="mailto:dxm15@psu.edu">dxm15@psu.edu</a>.
<br>Please forward any comments, questions, or suggestions concerning Java
to <a href="mailto:mwm126@psu.edu">mwm126@psu.edu</a>.
<p>If one of the applets doesn't work for you, please email <a href="mailto:mwm126@psu.edu">mwm126@psu.edu</a>
and indicate your browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer), your browser version
number, and your OS (Linux, Windows, Mac). (I developed most of the applets
on Windows using Netscape 4.x, so that should be the most reliable platform.)
They also seem to work with Windows Internet Explorer 5.0.
