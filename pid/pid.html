PID Control Model</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The flow rate (gpm) (red graph) is modeled as an on /off cycle
with a period of about 5 minutes.&nbsp; This might represent the load on
a commercial laundromat with several washers filling every few minutes.

<P>The second graph (white graph) represents the action of the steam control
valve in response to changes in the water temperature in the water heater
as represented by the third graph.&nbsp; (blue graph) The temperature set
point&nbsp; that you are trying to maintain&nbsp; is 140 F.

<P>Your goal is to adjust the proportional band (PB in yellow) until there
is only a slight overshoot as the result of a step change in the load (gpm).&nbsp;
Notice that the the temperature oscillates around the set point.&nbsp;
With too little PB, the valve cycles continuously.&nbsp; Next add some
integration (Gain in green) to ramp the proportionality error back toward
the set point.&nbsp;
